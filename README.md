# darkend_narrative_rep
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures from the manuscript:

ðŸ“„ Narrative â€˜Twistâ€™ Shifts Within-Individual Neural Representations of Dissociable Story Features
ðŸ“Œ Available on bioRxiv: DOI: 10.1101/2025.01.13.632631

## Requirements
This project was developed using:
- Python: 3.7.9
- R: 4.4.1

## Code Organization

All **code** subfolders correspond to a specific figure and set of analyses. Each subfolder contains its own **README** file that provides detailed descriptions of the included scripts and their functions.

We provide the necessary `.npy` and `.csv` files required to run the models and generate the corresponding figures. Additional behavioral files, such as character event data, can be found in their respective subfolders (e.g., the `characters` subfolder).

The **original raw MRI data** will be made publicly available on **OpenNeuro** upon publication.

If you need any additional information that is not included in this code directory, please feel free to reach out to **Clara Sava-Segal** at ðŸ“§ [csava.gr@dartmouth.edu](mailto:csava.gr@dartmouth.edu).
